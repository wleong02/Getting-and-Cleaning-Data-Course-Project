**Getting and Cleaning Data**

Course Project: Tidying Data

User: wleong02

**Overview**

The "run_analysis.R" script should be in a directory that also has the
Samsung data within (see
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>
for more information).

**The script performs the following:**

1\. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set

2\. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
(refer to CodeBook.md)

3\. Extracts only the variables that are mean and standard deviation for
each measurement

4\. Applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
data set

5\. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject (summarytidydata.txt)
